Basically the concept is very easy, so let me explain:

Introduction:
We have ratio 70% and 30%
But it only works for to objects, but what if we had more?

At this point, we can approach to the answer in two different ways:
1. We have 70% and 30%, right? So lets take the biggest one and split it in 70% and 30%.
Now we have 49%, 30% and 21%, so lets once again take the biggest one and split it in 70% and 30%.
Now we have 34.4%, 30%, 21% and 14.7%
etc.
Was pretty easy, am I right?
But, in this case we can see that they are becoming approximately equal pretty fast, and that's the problem.

2. We have 70% and 30%. Lets take the smallest one and split it in 70% and 30%.
Now we have 70%, 21% and 9%, once again.
Now we have 70%, 21%, 6.3% and 2.7%.
etc.
Again, easy, BUT
Now we can see that it is belong small too fast and very soon we will reach 0.

How can we fix it?
One of the solution that I came up with is to take average between both of them.
So, such as, first we have:
70%, 30%, lets split them
now we have:
[1]: 49% ; 70%
[2]: 30% ; 21%
[3]: 21% ; 9%

Average between corresponding by index numbers will be:
59.5%, 25.5% and 15%
And now we can see both distribution and domination,
So as for me, it's perfect solution to this problem.
