So, Text Generator.
You may ask, "How are you going to generate text?",
My answer is very easy, so let's say we have 1D array.
It invovles index and value, and lets say we have alphabet, what if indexes where referencing to character code,
that way, what value should reference to? In my opinion it should reference to probability of that character being used.
It looks something like this:
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |...| X | Y | Z |
| 4%| 3%| 4%| 2%| 5%| 2%| 1%| 2%| 3%|...| 4%| 1%| 2%|

BUT, what if we took 2D array? First of all, let's change system and instead of looking at one character we will look at two neighbours,

So not:
Hello world
  ^
  x

But:
Hello world
  ^^
  xy

And now we can look at first character as X coordinate and second as Y coordinate.
As you can see, we can expand it as many dimensions as we want, but i'll take 4, take it or leave it.
